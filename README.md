I’ve designed a challenge. This challenge is based on a Hack with Ack challenge. The beauty of doing it this way is:

It’s more practical and I can observe how you work doing exactly the same thing you will be doing on the job.

When you complete this challenge, you’ll already have written a bunch of good-looking ReactJS code that you can just plug right into the website.


So here’s the challenge:

Go to https://formgptfrontend.vercel.app/, the hosting page of FormGPT (please do not share this link!). Sign up. Create a form. Fill out that form. You’ve already seen the two worst pages on the entire website. Namely, the form creation (and its respective editing page) and the form filling page are by far the most messy and unprofessional pages on the website. Your job is simple, redesign those two pages (bonus points if you suggest changes for any others!). You can see the current source code for these two pages at https://github.com/Username-107/FormGPT-Intern-Challenge. You have 5 days, starting at the send time of this email, to complete the challenge. To submit, you should reply to me with the following:

Your code, preferably in a GitHub repository

A screenshot and/or a screencast (Loom) of both pages running


You may suggest changes to the FormGPT backend along with your submission, but preferably no huge changes should be made to make your code work.
